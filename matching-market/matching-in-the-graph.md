# Matching in The Graph

Queries are served for subgraphs in The Graph by way of a matching market. The primary market participant roles are developers and indexers. Developers want queries served for their subgraphs of interest. Indexers want to profit from payments for indexing subgraphs and serving queries. Importantly, a subgraph must be indexed prior to being queried. For a particular subgraph, interactions between indexers and developers take part in two stages. In the first stage, a form of signaling is done to communicate to indexers which subgraphs are valuable to index. Once an indexer indexes a subgraph, the second stage uses a gateway to facilitate the exchange of served queries by indexers for GRT payments from developers.

Curation aims to tackle the signaling problem, which is discussed more here:

The problem solved by gateways is addressed here.
