# Proof of Indexing

(High level description of what these are)



These verify indexers are indexing subgraphs correctly.

May be stuff happening with GraphCast to help indexers more readily check with each other\
(_e.g._ in case there are determinism bugs on a subgraph).



Currently, a PoI is only required when closing an allocation, not when opening it.&#x20;
