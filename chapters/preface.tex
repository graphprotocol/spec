This document is an evolving specification overview of mechanisms in The Graph protocol. Multiple existing media exist for learning about The Graph,\textsuperscript{$\dagger$} and these differ from our scope. 
Here our focus is on the mathematical and mechanism design aspects of various components within The Graph, which includes (but is not limited to) finalized descriptions of implemented Graph Improvement Proposals (GIPs).
