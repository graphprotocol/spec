# The Graph Protocol Economics

This document is an evolving specification overview of mechanisms in The Graph's protocol. Multiple existing media exist for learning about The Graph, and these differ from our scope. Here our focus is on the mathematical and mechanism design aspects of various components within The Graph, which primarily includes (but is not limited to) finalized descriptions of implemented Graph Improvement Proposals (GIPs).

_This repo contains LaTex (.tex) and Markdown (.md) files for outlining the documentation, with the intention of making two mirrored methods for reading, a self-contained .pdf file and a Gitbook page._
